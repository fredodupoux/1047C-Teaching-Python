OUTPUT:     Current Cost of Frames
            Current Discount Amount
            Current Net Amount
            Current Sales Tax
            Current Amount Due

            Total number of customers processed
            Total number of 8x10 picture frames sold
            Total cost of 8x10 picture frames sold
            Total amount of discounts
            Total of sales tax
            Total of amount due


INPUT:      Number of Frames
            Price of frames


PROCESS:    Validate Number of Frames ( > 0 and <= 75) 
            Validate Price of Frames >= 16.95 and  <= 25.95. 
            Calculate Cost Of Frames (Number of Frames * Price of Frames)
            Determine Discount Rate based on Number of Frames
            Calculate Discount Amount (Cost Of Frames * Discount Rate)
            Calculate Net Amount (Cost of Frames â€“ Discount Amount)
            Calculate Sales Tax ( Net Amount * Sales Rate)
            Calculate Amount Due ( Net Amount + Sales Tax)

            Accumulate Number Of Customers
            Accumulate Number Of Frames 
            Accumulate Total cost of 8x10 picture frames sold
            Accumulate Total amount of discounts
            Accumulate Total of sales tax
            Accumulate Total of amount due
