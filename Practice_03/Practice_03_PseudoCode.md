### INPUT
- Number of Frames
- Price of frames

### PROCESS
- Validate Number of Frames (> 0 and <= 75)
- Validate Price of Frames (>= 16.95 and <= 25.95)
- Calculate Cost Of Frames (Number of Frames * Price of Frames)
- Determine Discount Rate based on Number of Frames
- Calculate Discount Amount (Cost Of Frames * Discount Rate)
- Calculate Net Amount (Cost of Frames â€“ Discount Amount)
- Calculate Sales Tax (Net Amount * Sales Rate)
- Calculate Amount Due (Net Amount + Sales Tax)
- Accumulate Number Of Customers
- Accumulate Number Of Frames
- Accumulate Total cost of 8x10 picture frames sold
- Accumulate Total amount of discounts
- Accumulate Total of sales tax
- Accumulate Total of amount due

### Pseudo Code

```plaintext
Define Sales Tax 7.5%
Define price Ranges - PRICE_RANGE_MIN - PRICE_RANGE_MAX
Define Frame Range - MIN_FRAME - MAX_FRAME
Define Discount Brackets - DISCOUNT_5 - DISCOUNT_10 - DISCOUNT_15
Define Discount Values - DISCOUNT_5_VALUE - DISCOUNT_10_VALUE - DISCOUNT_15_VALUE

Initialize Total Number Of Customer = 0
Initialize Total Number Of Frames = 0
Initialize Total Cost Of Frames = 0
Initialize Total Discount = 0
Initialize Total Sales Tax = 0
Initialize Total Amount Due = 0
