--- HW00 DESCRIPTION ---
Create the OIP, Pseudo code and the program that allows the user to enter the
number of 8x10 picture frames being purchased. Calculate and display the cost of
the 8x10 picture frames, amount of discount, net amount, the sales tax, and
amount due. The 8x10 picture frames sell for $19.95 each. Use a sales tax rate of
7.5%. The store has the following discount structure:
8x10 Frames discount
1 to 5 > 0%
6 to 10 > 5%
11 to 15 > 10%
Over 15 > 15%

--- OIP ---
OUTPUT: Cost of frames, 
		Amount of discount, 
		Net amount, 
		Sales tax, 
		Amount due

INPUT:	Number of Frames to purchase

PROCESS: Set discount rate based on quantity of frames being purchased: 
	If 	1 ≤ number of frames ≤ 5 set discount rate to 0%
	If  6 ≤ number of frames ≤ 10 set discount rate to 5%
	If  11 ≤ number of frames ≤15 set discount rate to 10%
	If number of frames > 15 set discount rate to 15%

Calculate Cost of Frames (Number of Frames * Frame Cost) 
Calculate Amount of Discount (Cost of Frames * Discount Rate)
Calculate Net Amount (Cost of Frames - Amount of Discount)
Calculate Sales Tax (Net Amount * Sales Tax Rate)
Calculate Amount Due (Net Amount + Sales Tax)
Display formatted output rounded to two digits.
